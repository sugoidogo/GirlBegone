# GirlBegone
A mod for Lethal Company which removes the Girl from the game.
This is an updated build of [GirlBegone by Stoops417](https://github.com/Stoops417/GirlBegone),
based on [SpidersBegone by tinyhoot](https://github.com/tinyhoot/SpidersBegone).
This mod tells the enemy spawner not to use the girl enemy.
Also included is a modified [F_CKSpiders by Odie](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Odie/F_CKSpiders/) patch which kills the girl if she spawns by any other method.
